==== alg can be retrieved from jwks ====
#Since JWKs provides info about the algorithm we can
#retrieve it from them when looking for the verifier key.
#We have to options: keep the user input alg for all the
#iteration, and skip keys with differents arguments or,
#change alg when the JWK use a different one.
#If we use the second option, make sure to handle exceptions
#raised when we try to verify the signature with a different
#key type


==== user should not have to specify an alg ====
#During verification operations, changing the algorithm
#will broke the signature, so we should not ask the user
#to specify an algorithm. Not only that, but also, if he
#pass one, it should be ignored, displaying a proper
#warning.
